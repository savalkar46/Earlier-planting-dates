# Earlier-planting-dates
This repository has the codes to replicate the analysis for any code for the paper: Earlier planting in a future climate fails to replicate historical production conditions for US spring wheat. To replicate all the results of the paper one will have to go through the four steps.

Step 1: 

Step 2:

Step 3: This step determines the Wasserstein distance between future temperature exposure for every growth stage, time frame, emission scenario, and planting dates (traditional and advanced) and the historical temperature exposure for traditional planting dates. 

Step 4:
